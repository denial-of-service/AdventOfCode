# AdventOfCode

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual coding challenge.
Each day during Advent, a new problem consisting of two parts is released.
This project contains my Python solutions for all the problems I've solved so far.

The solutions prioritize readability.
The two parts of each problem are treated independently, which is why some code duplication is tolerated.

Advent of Code prohibits sharing puzzle inputs.
To comply, this project automatically downloads your personal input from the website and caches it to a file.
Since puzzle inputs are user-specific, the provided tests will likely fail on your machine.

## Instructions

1. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/denial-of-service/AdventOfCode/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
1. [Log into Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/auth/login).
1. Locate your session cookie:  
   In Firefox, press F12, go to the Storage tab, open the Cookies section,
   then click on https<nolink>://adventofcode.com and copy the long string under the Value column.
1. Create a file named `cookie.txt` in the root folder of the project.
   Paste your session cookie into it and save.
1. Run the Python file for the day you want to solve to get the solution for your puzzle input.
